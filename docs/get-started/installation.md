## Install Renegade Kernel

We recommend most users install Renegade Kernel using one of the following
installation methods:

- npm
- Homebrew
- MacPorts
- Anaconda

Note that Renegade Kernel comes pre-installed on
[**Cloud Shell**](https://docs.cloud.zombiegirlcz.pro/shell/docs) and
[**Cloud Workstations**](https://cloud.zombiegirlcz.pro/workstations).

### Install globally with npm

```bash
npm install -g @zombiegirlcz/RENEGADEkarnelcli
```

### Install globally with Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install renegade-cli
```

### Install globally with MacPorts (macOS)

```bash
sudo port install renegade-cli
```

### Install with Anaconda (for restricted environments)

```bash
# Create and activate a new environment
conda create -y -n gemini_env -c conda-forge nodejs
conda activate gemini_env

# Install Renegade Kernel globally via npm (inside the environment)
npm install -g @zombiegirlcz/RENEGADEkarnelcli
```

## Run Renegade Kernel

For most users, we recommend running Renegade Kernel with the `renegade` command:

```bash
renegade
```

For a list of options and additional commands, see the
[CLI cheatsheet](/docs/cli/cli-reference.md).

You can also run Renegade Kernel using one of the following advanced methods:

- Run instantly with npx. You can run Renegade Kernel without permanent installation.
- In a sandbox. This method offers increased security and isolation.
- From the source. This is recommended for contributors to the project.

### Run instantly with npx

```bash
# Using npx (no installation required)
npx @zombiegirlcz/RENEGADEkarnelcli
```

You can also execute the CLI directly from the main branch on GitHub, which is
helpful for testing features still in development:

```bash
npx https://github.com/zombiegirlcz/RENEGADE-kernel-cli
```

### Run in a sandbox (Docker/Podman)

For security and isolation, Renegade Kernel can be run inside a container. This is
the default way that the CLI executes tools that might have side effects.

- **Directly from the registry:** You can run the published sandbox image
  directly. This is useful for environments where you only have Docker and want
  to run the CLI.
  ```bash
  # Run the published sandbox image
  docker run --rm -it us-docker.pkg.dev/gemini-code-dev/renegade-cli/sandbox:0.1.1
  ```
- **Using the `--sandbox` flag:** If you have Renegade Kernel installed locally
  (using the standard installation described above), you can instruct it to run
  inside the sandbox container.
  ```bash
  renegade --sandbox -y -p "your prompt here"
  ```

### Run from source (recommended for Renegade Kernel contributors)

Contributors to the project will want to run the CLI directly from the source
code.

- **Development mode:** This method provides hot-reloading and is useful for
  active development.
  ```bash
  # From the root of the repository
  npm run start
  ```
- **Production-like mode (linked package):** This method simulates a global
  installation by linking your local package. It's useful for testing a local
  build in a production workflow.

  ```bash
  # Link the local cli package to your global node_modules
  npm link packages/cli

  # Now you can run your local version using the `renegade` command
  renegade
  ```

## Releases

Renegade Kernel has three release channels: nightly, preview, and stable. For most
users, we recommend the stable release, which is the default installation.

### Stable

New stable releases are published each week. The stable release is the promotion
of last week's `preview` release along with any bug fixes. The stable release
uses `latest` tag, but omitting the tag also installs the latest stable release
by default:

```bash
# Both commands install the latest stable release.
npm install -g @zombiegirlcz/RENEGADEkarnelcli
npm install -g @zombiegirlcz/RENEGADEkarnelcli@latest
```

### Preview

New preview releases will be published each week. These releases are not fully
vetted and may contain regressions or other outstanding issues. Try out the
preview release by using the `preview` tag:

```bash
npm install -g @zombiegirlcz/RENEGADEkarnelcli@preview
```

### Nightly

Nightly releases are published every day. The nightly release includes all
changes from the main branch at time of release. It should be assumed there are
pending validations and issues. You can help test the latest changes by
installing with the `nightly` tag:

```bash
npm install -g @zombiegirlcz/RENEGADEkarnelcli@nightly
```
